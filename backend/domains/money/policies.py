"""
Money invariants and policy checks.

Pure functions — no I/O. Called by MoneyService BEFORE writing to the
ledger. Each function raises a typed exception with full context, never
returns a boolean (boolean checks invite silent skipping).

Why a separate file: invariants are the most important code in the money
domain. Keeping them in one place makes review easier and lets tests
target them directly.

    was never emitted (D-2 not yet wired up, or replay lagging), not that

    means the developer doesn't have the funds at all.
