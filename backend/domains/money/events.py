Money domain events.

Published by MoneyService AFTER a successful ledger append. Subscribers
(wallet projection, dashboard projection, notification dispatcher, audit
log) react to these without coupling to MoneyService internals.

Convention:
  • Every event carries the resulting `entry_id` for traceability
  • Every event carries `account_id` (str form) and `delta_cents`
  • Subscribers MUST be idempotent — events may be re-published in the
    case of restart / replay
