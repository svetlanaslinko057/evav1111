"""
Money — first bounded context.

Public surface:
  MoneyService       — orchestration / use-cases
  EscrowHeld, EscrowReleased, ...  — domain events
  Money              — typed value object (cents + currency)
  PolicyDenied, ... — re-exported invariant errors

Internal rules (enforced by architecture tests):
  • The ONLY module allowed to call `MoneyRepository._insert_one` /
    `db.money_ledger_events.*` / `db.dev_wallets.*` / `db.payments.*` /
    `db.payouts.*` is `domains/money/`.
  • Other code reaches money state via:
      - MoneyService (writes)
      - MoneyRepository projections (reads)
      - subscribing to events (reactions)
