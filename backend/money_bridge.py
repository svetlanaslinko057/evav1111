"""
Phase 2B PR-1 — Money write-path bridge.

This module is the **migration glue** from the 15 grandfathered legacy money
writers (escrow_layer.py, escrow_api.py, wayforpay_callback path, …) onto
the canonical `domains/money/MoneyService`.

Migration strategy (per user's operational principle for Phase 2B):

  legacy writer → legacy collections write (UNCHANGED)
                ↓
                → bridge_*  →  MoneyService.<op>  →  MoneyRepository.append()
                                                     (canonical `money_ledger_events`)

  Legacy collections (`escrows`, `escrow_payouts`, `dev_wallets`, …) keep
  being populated so existing readers do not break. As Phase 2B progresses
  we flip individual readers to query the canonical ledger; in Phase 2C/2D
  the legacy writes themselves get removed.

Idempotency contract:
  Every bridge call derives a deterministic `idempotency_key` from the
  business identifier (escrow_id, payout_id, invoice_id) so retries from
  the legacy path (e.g. a webhook re-fire, a manual admin force) NEVER
  double-charge. The MoneyService append already returns the existing
  entry on `DuplicateKeyError`, so this layer just has to pick stable keys.

Failure isolation:
  The bridge is INVOKED FROM legacy writers AFTER their own write succeeds.
  If the bridge itself fails (MoneyService not yet initialised, ledger
  index race during startup, currency unsupported, …) the bridge must
  NOT raise back into the legacy path — legacy correctness is preserved
  even if canonical mirror lags. All such failures are logged.

  This matches `module_motion.py`'s already-emergent convergence pattern
  (see audit/MONEY_WRITER_INVENTORY_ADDENDUM_2026-05-14.md §C) and is what
  makes the bridge safe to ship before the legacy paths are removed.
